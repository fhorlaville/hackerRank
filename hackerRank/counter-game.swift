//Louise and Richard play a game. They have a counter set to . Louise gets the first turn and the turns alternate thereafter. In the game, they perform the following operations.
//
//If  is not a power of , reduce the counter by the largest power of  less than .
//If  is a power of , reduce the counter by half of .
//The resultant value is the new  which is again used for subsequent operations.
//The game ends when the counter reduces to 1, i.e., , and the last person to make a valid
